        </p>
        <p>TC processes two types of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          First, TC processes the personal data that You sent us by way of email
          or filing a form in the website. Second, TC processes data that You
          communicate to Us when You create an account on TC
          website.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

          Your personal data to examine and answer Your request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purposes of processing for the creation of Your account are to
          provide to TC the minimum amount of information required to create an
          account and according to the principle of minimization.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p><strong>4.2 Legal basis</strong></p>
        <p>
          If You are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we

          basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis for the
          personal data that You communicate to Us in case of email and other
          communications is Your consent pursuant to Article 6, 1(a) GDPR. The
          legal basis for the personal data that You communicate to Us for the
          creation of the account, depending on the case, may be either Your
          consent pursuant to Article 6, 1(a) GDPR or for taking step prior to
          entering a contract. &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5. Period for which the personal data will be stored</strong>
        </p>

          for longer than it is absolutely necessary. In establishing
          contractual relations with You, TC stores Your personal data
          throughout the established relations. Typically, the Organization
          stores Your personal data for 10 (ten) years.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><strong>6. Disclosure and transfer of personal data</strong></p>

          transfer Your personal data to the following recipients under

          jurisdictions which are not subject to an adequacy decision granted by

          legal obligations and all reasonable safeguards to ensure that Your
